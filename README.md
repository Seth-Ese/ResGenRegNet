## ResGenRegNet: Enhancing Lung Cancer Detection through AI

### Introduction
ResGenRegNet represents a transformative state-of-art approach in the early detection of lung cancer, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI). Developed as part of a dissertation at Cardiff School of Technologies, Cardiff Metropolitan University, this AI model utilizes residual learning and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection from computed tomography (CT) scans. The innovation lies in its unique architecture that incorporates L2 regularization and dropout techniques across all layers, including shortcut connections, to tackle the challenges of imbalanced datasets and ensure robust generaliza Model Highlights
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Attains remarkable diagnostic precision with an average test accuracy of 98% across various cross-validation folds.
- **Advanced Architecture**: Features L2 regularization and dropout across all layers, including shortcut connections, setting it apart from traditional models.
- **Robust Dataset Utilization**: Employs a comprehensive dataset from [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bhmdr45bh2/4], , demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse patient demographics.
- **Future-Ready**: Paves the way for further AI advancements in medical diagnostics, offering a promising tool for early lung cancer screening and diagnosis.

### Implementation Overview
ResGenRegNet's methodology encompasses several stages: data collection, preprocessing, and a detailed model training process that addresses the issue of imbalanced datasets. Utilizing TensorFlow and additional GPU resources facilitated through Google Colab, the model was rigorously trained, validated, and tested, showcasing its precision and robustness through high precision, recall, and F1 scores. The research leverages a dataset of CT scans annotated by oncologists and radiologists, further processed through techniques like resizing and balancing to prepare for model training.

### Conclusions and Future Directions
The ResGenRegNet model significantly advances the integration of AI in lung cancer detection, overcoming key challenges in dataset imbalance and model generalization. Its development not only contributes to the field of medical diagnostics but also sets a new benchmark for future research. Moving forward, efforts will focus on expanding computational resources, broadening data collection, and refining model adaptability to enhance its applicability and effectiveness in real-world clinical settings.
